*Illustrating our proposed method Progressive Prompts and contrasting it with a simple
adaptation of progressive networks using prompt tuning. In the simple adaptation of progressive
networks we learn a separate prompt and repeat the frozen input embeddings for each new task.
This setup requires repeating input tokens for each task. In Progressive Prompts we use the same
input and progressively append new prompt for each new task. Prior task prompts are not modified
by the addition of new prompts.*
